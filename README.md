# MyLexicalAnalyzer
An overview of this: This project is one of many projects that demonstate my level of confidence and mastery in using C/C++. I use a variety of data structures and algorithms to implement my solution.
I can use many things from vectors to maps, as well as structs and buliding my own graph. This project is a lexical analyzer which takes in a regular expression(s) and an input text, which then 
is able to check for any syntax, semantic, or logical errors (whether the input text is valid or not). And this is all done primarily with the creation of my graphs which build the regular expressions.
